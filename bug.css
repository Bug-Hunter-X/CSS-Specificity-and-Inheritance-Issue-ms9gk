The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This rule is overridden due to specificity */
}

/*The parent div's color is inherited by the p element, 
but the more specific div p selector overrides the inherited color */
```
