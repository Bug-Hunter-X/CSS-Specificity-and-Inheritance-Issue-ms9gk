To resolve this issue, ensure a clear understanding of CSS specificity and inheritance.  Re-order the CSS rules based on specificity, making sure that the intended styles are applied.   For example, you might adjust the CSS to:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green;
}

/* Add an id or class for more clarity if you wish to target specific divs
#specificDiv p {
  color:purple;
}
*/
```

In the adjusted CSS we define the div, then p elements and finally how it should apply when a paragraph element is nested inside the div element. The correct specificity should be used to avoid style overriding.
